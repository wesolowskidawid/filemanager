# File Manager - Clean directories

This Python script organizes the files in your Downloads folder by automatically sorting them into subfolders based on their file types. The script scans the Downloads directory, identifies the file types, and then moves each file into a corresponding subfolder such as "Documents", "Images", "Videos", "Music", and "Others". It utilizes Python's 'os' and 'pathlib' modules to handle file operations and ensure a clean and organized Downloads folder. This script is perfect for keeping your Downloads directory tidy and easily navigable.
